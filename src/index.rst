Greenbone Source Edition â€“ Documentation
========================================

The Greenbone Source Edition (GSE) covers the actual source code of the
Greenbone vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management (GVM) application
stack.

It is available as regularly updated source code snapshots/release archives
confirmed to work and as source code checkouts directly from the source code
management (SCM) system. The latter is not recommended for production scenarios
as the code is edited on a daily basis and issues and incomplete functionality
may appear.

The Greenbone Source Edition is adopted by third parties, for example Linux
distributions like Kali, Alpine, etc.

Currently, two version of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) are
supported:

* GVM 20.08
* GVM 21.04

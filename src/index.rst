The Greenbone Source Edition (GSE) covers the actual source code of the
Greenbone application stack for vulnerability scanning and vulnerability
management (GVM).

It is available as regularly updated source code snapshots/releases archives
confirmed to work and as source code checkouts directly from the source code
management (SCM) system. The latter is not recommended for production scenarios
as the code is being worked on on a daily basis and might reveal issues and
incomplete features.

The Greenbone Source Edition is adopted by third parties for example Linux
Distributions like Kali, Alpine, etc.

Greenbone, GVM and OpenVAS how are they connected
-------------------------------------------------

When the OpenVAS project was created it only consisted of an engine for scanning
vulnerabilities. Shortly after Greenbone Networks was funded to achieve
professional support for vulnerability scanning. Greenbone started to lead the
development, added several software components and turned OpenVAS into a
vulnerability management solution still keeping the values of free software.

After several years it became obvious that using OpenVAS as the brand name for
the open source project and funding nearly all development of the project wasnâ€™t
recognized from the outside. Therefore after the release of the OpenVAS 9
framework it got renamed to Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) and
released as Greenbone Source Edition (GSE). Since GVM 10 the term OpenVAS is
only used for the scanner component as it was at the beginning of the project.

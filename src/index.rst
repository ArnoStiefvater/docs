Greenbone Source Edition â€“ Documentation
========================================

The Greenbone Source Edition (GSE) covers the actual source code of the
Greenbone application stack for vulnerability scanning and vulnerability
management (GVM).

It is available as regularly updated source code snapshots/releases archives
confirmed to work and as source code checkouts directly from the source code
management (SCM) system. The latter is not recommended for production scenarios
as the code is being worked on on a daily basis and might reveal issues and
incomplete features.

The Greenbone Source Edition is adopted by third parties for example Linux
Distributions like Kali, Alpine, etc.

Currently two version of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) are
supported

* GVM 20.08
* GVM 21.04

Greenbone, GVM, OpenVAS and How They Are Connected
==================================================

When the OpenVAS project was created, it only consisted of an engine for scanning
vulnerabilities.

Shortly after that, Greenbone Networks was founded to achieve
professional support for vulnerability scanning. Greenbone started to lead the
development, added several software components and turned OpenVAS into a
vulnerability management solution still keeping the values of free software.

After several years it became obvious that using OpenVAS as the brand name for
the open source project and funding nearly all development of the project was not
recognized from the outside. Therefore, after the release of the OpenVAS 9
framework, it got renamed to Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) and
released as Greenbone Source Edition (GSE). Since GVM 10 the term OpenVAS is
only used for the scanner component as it was at the beginning of the project.
